## Release discipline

> **RCs are a hard freeze point.**  
> Once a release candidate (`vX.Y.Z-rc`) is created, **do not modify**:
>
> - release workflows or scripts  
> - files committed by the release process  
>
> Any change to release automation or release-managed files **invalidates the RC** and requires cutting a new one.
