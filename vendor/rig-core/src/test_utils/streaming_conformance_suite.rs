//! The declarative per-wire-family conformance suite macro.
//!
//! [`streaming_conformance_suite!`](crate::streaming_conformance_suite)
//! expands the full canonical scenario set for one wire family — one named
//! `#[tokio::test]` per scenario — plus an anti-tamper test (the langchain
//! `standard-tests` precedent: capability flags gate skips inside test
//! bodies, never test deletion, and an inherited completeness check proves no
//! scenario was dropped):
//!
//! - `suite_is_complete`: the expanded scenario list equals
//!   [`CANONICAL_SCENARIOS`](crate::test_utils::streaming_conformance::CANONICAL_SCENARIOS),
//!   and every `xfail` entry names a canonical scenario with a reason. The
//!   list it checks (`EMITTED_SCENARIOS`) is *generated from the same entries
//!   as the test functions* by
//!   [`__streaming_conformance_scenarios`](crate::__streaming_conformance_scenarios),
//!   so it cannot be a hand-written twin that agrees with itself: deleting a
//!   scenario deletes it from both sides and the check fails (#2258 G6).
//!
//! Capability flags are not written in the invocation at all: each gated test
//! derives them from the fixture itself
//! ([`ProviderWireFixture::capabilities`](crate::test_utils::streaming_conformance::ProviderWireFixture::capabilities)),
//! so a flag structurally cannot drift from the wire fixture that backs it —
//! the shapes the fixture supplies *are* the declared capability set.
//!
//! Capability-gated scenarios expand to *visible named skips*, never absence
//! and never a vacuous pass: a scenario that skips while its capability is
//! declared fails, and one that runs while the capability is disclaimed also
//! fails (#2258 review, F8 corpus-honesty batch).
//!
//! The workspace registry test (`all_wire_families_have_conformance_suites`
//! in `tests/core/streaming_conformance_registry.rs`) enumerates
//! [`WIRE_FAMILIES`](crate::test_utils::streaming_conformance::WIRE_FAMILIES)
//! and fails CI when any family lacks an invocation naming it.
