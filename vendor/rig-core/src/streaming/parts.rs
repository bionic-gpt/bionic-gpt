//! Accumulation of streamed events into the ordered parts of one assistant
//! choice — as **entities with a lifecycle**, not id-keyed event sequences.
//!
//! Every part runs open → mutate → close (review 84a43e9e root cause A):
//!
//! - **open** registers the part in `parts` once, fixing arrival order, and
//!   tracks it in an open-set keyed by its opaque [`StreamPartId`];
//! - **deltas** mutate the open part in place through that handle;
//! - **close** applies the end event's authoritative payload (a whole-block
//!   restatement supersedes the delta accumulation; a trailing signature
//!   attaches), then moves the key to a finished-set.
//!
//! The finished-set is the entity's `hasFinished` (vercel's
//! `streaming-tool-call-tracker`): **every** finalization route consults and
//! populates it, so a repeated end event — whatever payload it carries — is
//! a no-op rather than a duplicate part, and the guard cannot be forgotten
//! on one route. A key genuinely reused after finishing (new fragments, a
//! same-key whole block) opens a **new** part: the lenient reuse rule that
//! replaces the old ordinal machinery.
//!
//! There is no interleaving-boundary machinery here. Wires that never
//! announce block boundaries have their adapters *synthesize* the end
//! events at the boundaries they already detect (openai-agents' "the
//! adapter synthesizes canonical events" pattern) — one grammar, stated
//! once, instead of per-wire lifecycle re-derivation.
//!
//! Reference designs: vercel-ai-sdk's `stream-text` accumulator (`-start`
//! registers and pushes the handle once, `-delta` mutates through it,
//! `-end` deletes it) and pydantic-ai's `_stop_tracking_vendor_id`.
