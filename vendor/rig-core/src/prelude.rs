//! The `rig` prelude.
//!
//! Bringing this module into scope with `use rig::prelude::*` pulls in the
//! portable provider-client, completion, embedding, tool, and vector-store
//! contracts.
//!
//! This is deliberately the *common* path, not the whole crate. Advanced
//! surfaces — the hook system, the run-loop stepping types, message content
//! blocks, tool authoring internals, extraction/loaders/memory, etc. — are
//! imported explicitly from their modules so those imports document intent.

// Provider-client traits.
