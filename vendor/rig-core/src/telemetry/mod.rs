//! This module primarily concerns being able to orchestrate telemetry across a given pipeline or workflow.
//! This includes tracing, being able to send traces to an OpenTelemetry collector, setting up your
//! agents with the correct tracing style so you can emit the right traces for platforms like Langfuse,
//! and more.

/// By default the span is explicitly parented on

/// accepts (including `None`). `operation` and `system_instructions` are
/// declared with the given values; the provider records
/// `gen_ai.provider.name` and `gen_ai.request.model` at adoption time.
/// Additional runtime-specific fields may be appended after the named
/// arguments. Extra fields must not repeat the marker or a required contract
/// field: a duplicate compiles, but the span then declares two same-named
