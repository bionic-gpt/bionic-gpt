BionicGPT allows you to deploy API's company wide that use Retrieval Augmented Generation to give results based on your data.

This allows you to create Chat Bots or other applications that respond with intelligence gathered from your documents.

## Creating an API end point

From the API Keys menu option select to add a new key.

Please note

1. API Keys are attached to prompts
1. Prompts are attached to datasets

So when creating a key your are attaching that key to a particular prompt and dataset(s). This is what gives the API end point intelligence related to a particular subject.
