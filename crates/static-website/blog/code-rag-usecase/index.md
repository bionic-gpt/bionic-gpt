Legacy software is the backbone of many critical systems in large organisations, including banking and finance. 
Yet, it's also a major headache for IT teams. Outdated codebases, abandoned by their original developers, require 
constant updates to remain relevant. The question is, can AI provide a solution to this problem?

Recently, startups have emerged, offering bespoke models tailored to specific codebases. But what if there was a 
more efficient way to tackle this challenge?

Could RAG provide the way to help manage legacy software. By combining RAG with an open-source model trained on code, 
you can quickly and easily unlock the secrets of your legacy system.

Imagine having a single, searchable source of truth for your entire codebase, including JIRAs, documentation, commit 
comments, issues, and more. With a vector database, you can consolidate all relevant information into one place, making 
it easy to identify areas that need attention.

That's where bionicGPT comes in. Our no-code RAG pipeline allows you to create a single dataset, load it with multiple data sources, and access specialised models to test and refine your approach in just days. Could this get you to 80% at very little cost and risk
