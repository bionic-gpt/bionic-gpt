## Categorising Credit Card Spend Assistant

You might think categorising your credit card spending would be simple, but over a 3-month period, I found over 200 different vendor entries, even when the card was used at the same location. Let's build an AI assistant to help streamline this process.

### System Prompt

```
You are a credit card spending categorisation assistant.
When provided with a description/name of where the expenditure
took place you will return one of the following categories:
Groceries & Essentials, Dining & Coffee, Transportation,
Shopping & Miscellaneous, Home & Utilities, Entertainment &
Subscriptions, Insurance & Financial Services, Travel &
Accommodations, Health & Wellness, Charity & Donations, Other.

Some examples of entries can be found below

Ensure you just return just the category without any explanation.
This is for another system that only expects the category.
```

Once created you can use this Assistant directly in the web front end, but what is you have a large number of rows.
For this you can use bionicGPT's API. Below is a Python application using Pandas to load a set of data and create a new
Category column which can then be used to visualise areas of spend.


```
import pandas as pd
import requests
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv('/Users/xxx/card-payments.csv')

# Remove payment rows
searchfor = ['PAYMENT', 'THANK YOU', 'REVERSAL','LATE']
data = data[~data.vendor.str.contains('|'.join(searchfor))]



api_key = "xxxx"
url="http://192.168.86.208/v1/chat/completions"

def get_chat_completion(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
    }

    data = {
        "model": "llama3",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "stream": False
    }

    # Send the POST request with streaming disabled
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    print(response.text)
    # Parse the response as JSON
    try:
        json_response = response.json()
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Error: Could not decode the response as JSON.")
        return None

    # Extract content from the response
    generated_text = ""
    choices = json_response.get("choices", [])
    for choice in choices:
        content = choice.get("message", {}).get("content", "")
        generated_text += content

    return generated_text



#Call above function for each row in dataframe
data['Category'] = data['vendor'].apply(get_chat_completion)


```
