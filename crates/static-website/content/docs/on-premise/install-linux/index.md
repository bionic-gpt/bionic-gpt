# K3s Installation

To run Bionic we'll install a very lightweight Kubernetes onto our system using [K3s](https://k3s.io/)

### 1. Install K3s

```sh
sudo curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC='server --disable=traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode="644"' sh -
mkdir -p ~/.kube
cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config && sed -i "s,127.0.0.1,$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'),g" ~/.kube/config
```

### 2. Install K9s (Optional)

```sh
curl -L -s https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases/download/v0.24.15/k9s_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/k9s /usr/local/bin
rm -rf k9s_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

### 3. Check your K3s install

```sh
kubectl get pods
# No resources found in default namespace.
```

## 4. Install the Bionic CLI

```sh
export BIONIC_VERSION=v1.8.26
curl -OL https://github.com/bionic-gpt/bionic-gpt/releases/download/${BIONIC_VERSION}/bionic-cli-linux && chmod +x ./bionic-cli-linux && sudo mv ./bionic-cli-linux /usr/local/bin/bionic
```

Try it out

```sh
bionic -V
```

## 5. Install the application into K3s

```sh
bionic install
```

If you get the error below then wait a bit longer. The cluster is still coming up.

```sh
Error: ApiError: "service unavailable\n": Failed to parse error data (ErrorResponse { status: "503 Service Unavailable", message: "\"service unavailable\\n\"", reason: "Failed to parse error data", code: 503 })
```

## The Finished Result

After a while of container creation you should see all the pods running and then be able to access Bionic.

## Run the User Interface

You can then access the front end from `http://localhost` and you'll be redirected to a registration screen.

## Registration

The first user to register with **BionicGPT** will become the system administrator. The information is kept local to your machine and your data is not sent anywhere.

## Uninstall Bionic

First we can remove K3s entirely. K3s comes with it's own uninstall script.

```sh
k3s-uninstall.sh
```

Then you can remove the bionic cli

```sh
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/bionic
```

And also remove k9s if you want to.

```sh
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/k9s
```
