# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously. We are delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of **Bionic-GPT**. The use of the Internet pages of **Bionic-GPT** is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.

The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, email address, or telephone number of a data subject, shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to **Bionic-GPT**. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise aims to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of the rights to which they are entitled.

As the controller, **Bionic-GPT** has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may, in principle, have security gaps, so absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, such as by telephone.

### e) Profiling

Profiling involves automated processing of personal data to evaluate personal aspects, particularly to analyze or predict aspects such as work performance, health, personal preferences, or behaviour.

The controller is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

### h) Processor

A processor processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

### i) Recipient

A recipient is an entity to which personal data is disclosed.
