# Credit Card Categorisation Assistant

This use case demonstrates how an agent classifies incoming credit card support emails with precise tool interactions. You will learn how to define categories, how to capture confidence scores, and when to escalate to manual review.

We also include a sample evaluation harness to ensure the workflow hits latency and accuracy targets before it reaches production.
