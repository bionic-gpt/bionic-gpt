# Architect Course Overview

This course walks technical leads through three capabilities: spinning up a local Gen AI lab, experimenting with agentic workflows, and operationalizing the stack for production. Each numbered module builds on the previous one—start with section 01 to install the reference model, move to section 02 for agent patterns, and finish with section 03 to prepare your infrastructure for enterprise rollout.
