# Using Our Integrations

Learn how to activate out-of-the-box integrations inside the console and verify they are wired to your assistant.

## Steps

1. Open the Integrations page in the console.
2. Enable the integration you want to test and provide the required credentials or API keys.
3. Assign the integration to your assistant or workspace.
4. Run a quick prompt that requires the integration and check the tool-call details to confirm it executed.

## Tips

- Start in a sandbox workspace before rolling out to production projects.
- Rotate any provided tokens after testing and store them in your secrets manager.
- If calls fail, check the integration logs and review required scopes for the selected action.
