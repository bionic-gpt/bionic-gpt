# Getting started with Deploy

Deploy gives platform teams a managed runtime for building and operating AI assistants. This quickstart walks through the
core steps to launch your first workflow.

## 1. Create a project

1. Sign in to the Deploy console and create a new project.
2. Invite teammates so they can configure data sources and monitor runs.

## 2. Connect your knowledge

Use Deploy connectors to sync documents from S3, SharePoint, or your product knowledge base. Deploy handles chunking and
embeddings so the data is ready for retrieval immediately.

## 3. Design assistant workflows

Compose assistants from steps like retrieval, function calling, and evaluation. Deploy lets you mix and match models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, and self-hosted runtimes.

## 4. Launch with confidence

Ship changes through staging environments, set usage guardrails, and track every interaction from the activity feed. When
you are ready to scale, Deploy auto-tunes infrastructure so your assistants stay fast and reliable.
