BionicGPT collects together all the components needed to deploy a Generative AI solution in your company.

![Alt text](/github-readme.png "Start Screen")

BionicGPT was designed from the beginning to run on modest hardware and then scale into more powerful hardware when required.

This gives us the following benefits

1. You can get a feel for how Generative AI might work for your use cases without having access to powerful hardware. We aim to be able to run run on most laptops with around 16GB ram.
1. You don't need to engage with a sales person for a demonstration. 

BionicGPT is open source. If you have any suggestions, recommendations are just have any questions you can either [contact us](/contact) or raise an issue on our github.

## LLama 2 7B

For installations on modest hardware we run a quantized model with 7 billion parameters.

However typically larger models give better results and if you have access to a model with for example 70 billion parameters you'll get some great results.

We still believe this is a great way to start to look at the ways LLM's can help out in your company. We've tried to minimise the time it takes to go from idea to practical proof of concept.
