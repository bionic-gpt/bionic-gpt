Every project is different and has its own requirements and nuances. Our consulting services focus on delivering the right assistance to ensure you get the most value out of the Bionic platform.

Some common requests that fall under the scope of consulting services are customizations such as the development of new chunking techniques, creation of new dashboards, deployment services, health checks, integrations with third-party tools, or the development of additional features.

This service is typically acquired together with the support and maintenance service for a 360 Bionic experience.
