# Introduction

This project is based on the [Rust on Nails](https://rust-on-nails.com/) architecture.

## Setup for Development

This project uses the [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension so we can define the runtime and development stack with code. The configuration is in the `.devcontainer`.

Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and Visual Studio Code Remote. Make sure you have the Remote Containers extension installed. 

After you have run `git clone` on this repository open the folder for the project in Visual Studio Code.

Then click on the green square in the bottom left hand corner of VSCode. (It's the gree square with < and > in the screenshot above). A menu pops down, choose `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

It will take a while for the containers to download.

## Sanity check your dev environment.

Open up the terminal using Use the `View > Terminal` menu command or ``CTRL/CMD ` ``

You can type the following commands in the Linux command prompt.

* rustc --version
* npm -v 
* psql -V
* k3d

## We develop and test in Kubernetes

To stay as close as possible to production at all times we develop with a local version of Kubernetes called [k3d](https://k3d.io) installed into the [.devcontainer](https://containers.dev/)

You'll need to create a cluster and install the necessary services into the cluster.

1. `k3d-create` This is a bash alias that calls k3d and creates a cluster and exposes some ports.
1. `k3d-dev-setup` Another bash alias. This will run the code to create services in the cluster such as authentication and a database.

If you get a *503 Service Unavailable* wait a little longer for the cluster to be ready.

If you have issues that the cluster is already created run `k3d-del` to delete the cluster.

## K9s - Visibility into the cluster

We have [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) pre installed which will allow you to see the services in the cluster starting up.

Just type `k9s`.

## Running Database Migrations

If you get an error *EOF* when running `dbmate` the database is not yet ready.

We use [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate) to manage database migrations.

```
$ dbmate status

[ ] 20220410155211_authentication.sql

```

Create all the database tables with

`dbmate up`


## Starting the services

We have created a `.bash_alias` file in the `.devcontainer` folder. Open up 3 consoles in visual studio code and run the following in each one.

1. `wp` - Watch Pipeline - compiles the web assets such as typescript, scss and processes images.
1. `wt` - Watch TailwindCSS - Runs tailwind to create an output.css file.
1. `wa` - Stands for watch application - compiles and runs the axum server and will recompile on file changes.
1. `wz` - Watch Zola - runs the static site generator.
1. `we` - Watch Embeddings - runs the embeddings job.

## Problems with permissions

If you get an error such as `Permission Denied` on the target folder run the following

`sudo chmod 777 -R target`

## Accessing the web front end.

`https://localhost:7700`
