I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you can benefit from your bug fixes and new features again.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. Iâ€™m sure you can fix this ðŸ’ª.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the \`${
    branch.name
  }\` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here are some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](${USAGE_DOC_URL})
- [Frequently Asked Questions](${FAQ_URL})
- [Support channels](${GET_HELP_URL})

If those donâ€™t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isnâ€™t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](${NEW_ISSUE_URL})**.
